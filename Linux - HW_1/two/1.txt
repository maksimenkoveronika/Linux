Hello!

My name Veronika!
I'm currently taking a course in testing, Linux commands.
When searching for files, grep is convenient to use to filter the output of the find command, as was shown at the beginning of the material. But if you need to find some file in the system by its name or part of the name (in this case, the mask * is used), then it is best to turn to find. It will display the exact location of the file you are looking for.
